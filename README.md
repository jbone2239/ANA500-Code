This project analyzes video game sales across different regions to identify underperforming platforms and genres and develop data-driven strategies to create a more balanced global market. The analysis is based on a dataset containing game sales, genre, platform, publisher, and regional sales (NA, EU, JP, Other).

Problem Statement
How can game developers increase video game sales across specific regions by identifying underperforming genres and platforms and implementing data-driven market strategies?

Hypothesis
Video game sales are influenced by genre, and aligning game genres with regional preferences will increase sales and contribute to a more balanced global market.

My code performs data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and modeling to understand regional video game sales trends and identify underperforming genres and platforms. The key focus is to analyze how game sales vary by region and determine strategies to increase sales in specific markets.
